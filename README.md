# A simple text-based game
This is the game I have made with my friend Jack as a project after one semester of learning python.

Every bit of it that has #RZ initials in the comment was made by me. Some things without any initials are also mine but might just be used in #JM code.

Any feedback regarding the **whole** code is highly appreaciated as I am a begginer and even by the end of making this project I could see some mistakes that I simply did not have time to fix. Please feel free to let me know what and why would you make differently.
